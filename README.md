         <h4>John 5:24 <br> 
          I tell you the truth, those who listen to my message and believe in God who sent me have eternal life. They will never be condemned for their sins, but 
          they already have passed from death to life. 
         </h4></p>
         <p>
          <h4>Cross References:</h4>
          1 John 3:14<br>
          We know that we already have passed from death to life because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death.<br><br>
          Keypoints:<br>
          1. Listen to the message<br>
          2. Believe in God<br>
          3. Will never be condemned for their sins<br>
          4. Eternal life<br>
          5. Passed from death to life
         </p>
         
         <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>One of the indicators that a person has moved from the realm of evil to real of God is LOVE. In order for us to pass from death to life is what is 
          being said in 1 John 3:14 "we should love each other" and 1 John 4:7-8 "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has 
          been born of God and knows God. Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love 
         </p>
         <p>So we may not be condemned from our sins and so we can have eternal life., we need to listen to God's message and believe in Him. And the very core of           God's message is His commandment to us that is to live like Christ, be like Christ - that is to love God and our neighbors as we love ourselves.
         </p>
         <p>God even command us to love our enemy - just like us when we were still sinners, we are considered His enemies. But God gave His Son to us so we may 
          be redeemed from darkness.
         </p>
         <p>And we can fully know and experience this kind of love that God has for us is when we read and listen to God's words and messages and believe to what 
          it says and believe God who is the major context of the Bible and Jesus as our Savior.
         </p>
         <p>Thus, what we feed our mind becomes our mindset and beliefs, so make it a habbit to read the Bible and apply it to your everyday life to have a 
          renewed and transformed life in Christ. Amen..

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>God in His very nature, which is love can't bear or endure to see us got separated from Him because of our sins. With His great love for us, He gave 
          His only begotten Son to us to cleanse us from our sins and redeemed us through Christ's death on the cross. God sacrificed His own son for us so we may 
          be reconciled with God. What a great love God has for us...</p>
          <p>Romans 8:32 Since He did not spare even His own son but gave him up for us all, won't he also give us everything else? God want us to be with Him in 
          His Kingdom; to get us back and be with Him forever and the reason why Jesus became flesh and acted as ransom for our sins... Romans 8:39 nothing in all 
          creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord. Isn't that a great love from God?
