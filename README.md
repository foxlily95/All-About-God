         <h4>John 5:24 <br> 
         I tell you the truth, those who listen to my message and believe in God who sent me have eternal life. They will never be condemned for their sins, but 
         they already have passed from death to life. 
         </h4></p>
         <p>
         <h4>Cross References:</h4>
         1 John 3:14<br>
         We know that we already have passed from death to life because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death.<br><br>
         Keypoints:<br>
         1. Listen to the message<br>
         2. Believe in God<br>
         3. Will never be condemned for their sins<br>
         4. Eternal life<br>
         5. Passed from death to life
         </p>
         
         <h4>Reflection</h4>
         <p>One of the indicators that a person has moved from the realm of evil to realm of God is LOVE. In order for us to pass from death to life is what is 
         being said in 1 John 3:14 "we should love each other" and 1 John 4:7-8 "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has 
         been born of God and knows God. Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love 
         </p>
         <p>So we may not be condemned from our sins and so we can have eternal life, we need to listen to God's message and believe in Him. And the very core of           God's message is His commandment to us that is to live like Christ, be like Christ - that is to love God and our neighbors as we love ourselves.
         </p>
         <p>God even command us to love our enemy - just like us when we were still sinners, we are considered His enemies. But God gave His Son to us so we may 
         be redeemed from darkness.
         </p>
         <p>And we can fully know and experience this kind of love that God has for us is when we read and listen to God's words and messages and believe to what 
         it says and believe God who is the major context of the Bible and Jesus as our Savior.
         </p>
         <p>Thus, what we feed our mind becomes our mindset and beliefs, so make it a habbit to read the Bible and apply it to your everyday life to have a 
         renewed and transformed life in Christ. Amen..

        <h4>2 Corinthians 5:18-19 <br> 
        All this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to 
        Himself in Christ, not counting people's sins against them. And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation

        3. Ministry of Reconciliation<br>
        4. Not Counting People's Sin<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>It is so evident how God loves us so much and would want us to be reconciled to Him. With His vast and unfathomable knowledge, wisdom and 
        understanding, He knew that the humankind would inherit the sins comitted by Adam and Eve and that everyone would fall short and will commit sin except 
        for One, the One He loves (Ephesians 1:6) and so He gave His Son to us as a ransom for our sins through the blood of Jesus, and we are now reconciled to 
        God and we can come freely to God without recalling and counting our sins
        </p>
        <p>The only thing that we should do is to be humble to accept our need to repent for our sins through Jesus, change our ways (Romans 12:2) and transform 
        our  mindset, trust and acknowledge God in all we do (Proverbs 3:5-6) and accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior - Romans 10:9-11 "That if you confess 
        with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord", and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you 
        believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved." As the scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in Him will never be put 
        to shame"

        And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them
        </h4>
        </p>

        Keypoints: <br>
        1. Rely on the love of God <br>
        2. God is love <br>
        3. Who lives in love lives in God <br>
        4. God lives to those who lives in love <br>
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>The very nature of God is love. He loves us whatever situation and status we are in. But sometimes with our limited understanding and circumstances 
        we encounter, we question and doubted the love of God; we sometimes tend to focus on the trick of the devil, the confusion and conflict the devil is 
        inflicting to us; the lies, envy, jealousy that the devil is making us feel so we would think we are worthless and we don't deserve the love of God. 
        But take note that God has always a good plan out of our situation; there's always a purpose and let's trust God on that purpose is for His glory and 
        that we may feel His unconditional love. Trust that God is love and when we believe in Him, we have the privilege to experience His love
        </p>
        <p>And as believers of God and if we want to represent God in our life, we should apply 1 Corinthians 16:14 "Let all that you do be done in love" and 
        because God is love and so we must love one another

        No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours, through Christ who loves us 
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>God in His very nature, which is love can't bear or endure to see us got separated from Him because of our sins. With His great love for us, He gave 
        His only begotten Son to us to cleanse us from our sins and redeemed us through Christ's death on the cross. God sacrificed His own son for us so we may 
        be reconciled with God. What a great love God has for us...</p>
        <p>Romans 8:32 Since He did not spare even His own son but gave him up for us all, won't he also give us everything else? God want us to be with Him in 
        His Kingdom; to get us back and be with Him forever and the reason why Jesus became flesh and acted as ransom for our sins... Romans 8:39 nothing in all 
        creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord. Isn't that a great love from God?

        <h4>1 Corinthians 16:14 <br> 
        Let everything you do be done in love
        </h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>It is difficult to do everything in love especially when you are not feeling ok, if you're feeling down, if you're struggling, if you're facing 
        problems, challenges, conflict and different adversities in life. But if we are going to look at the life of Jesus in the Bible, he too wasn't spared 
        from these kind of situations, He was persecuted, tempted, accused and betrayed. However, he overcame the different temptations and difficulties and 
        continued on his journey and did his role and God's purpose of His life.. that even the sinners whom considered to be God's enemies were saved because 
        that's what Jesus came for, to save the sinners and that's the great love of God and Jesus by giving up His own life, endured the pain and suffering on 
        the cross for us 
        </p>
        <p>
        In our present time, how can we do that? If we focus ourselves on the goal of being with God in his kingdom someday, we need to follow Jesus and deny 
        ourselves.. that is whatever situation we are in, we should always represent Jesus in our life, we don't lift ourselves up but people should be able to 
        praise and thank God for the experience they encounter through us. Since God is love and as Christians, we should represent God and thus we should love 
        our neighbors as we love ourselves. An example of this is empathy, compassion, grace, forgiveness, and the manifestation of the fruit of the Spirit and 
        its application in our life towards how we deal with other people

        <h4>Cross References:</h4>
        Luke 19:10<br>
        For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.<br><br>
        Romans 12:2<br>
        Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will 
        is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.<br><br>
        John 3:3<br>
        Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, unless you are born again, you cannot see the Kingdom of God.”
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
        It is easier said than done - ..to be a new creation, ..to be born again, ..be transformed. But what is it for us when we do these things? If we believe 
        that there is life after death, then where do you want to spend it? Our life here on earth is just temporary and our goal should be to prepare our soul 
        while we are still here, so when the time comes and God took our life, we will have our eternal life with God
        </p>
        <p>
        How can we be a new creation, be born again and be transformed? The Bible tells us to believe in Christ and follow Him, His teachings and how He 
        lived His life. Jesus became human, He experienced life the same way we are experiencing it today, so what He taught in the Bible is applicable to us 
        too.. He came to save us and He did it because of love. When we truly understand the depth of God's love for us and when we truly desire and 
        intentionally apply God's word in our life, we will become a new creation  
        </p>
        <p>
        Everyday is a new beginning where we can start a new way of thinking, another chance to live a new life and become better for God everyday for His glory.

        <h4>Ephesians 2:10 <br> 
        For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
        </h4>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>Cross References:</h4>
        Psalm 139:14<br>
        I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
        Of all God's creation, we are the most precious and wonderful one. Imagine that, God created man in His own image and likeness - Genesis 1:27. From the 
        very beginning, God expressed His great love for us that we were formed based from His own image, so when we look at our neighbors or brothers or sisters, 
        we can see God in them.
        </p>
        <p>
        And we know that God is good all the time.. His goodness is always with us (Psalm 23:6). Everything good comes from God (James 1:17). He fills our hungry 
        souls with good things (Psalm 107:8-9). He is good, does good, and gives good gifts to his children (Psalm 119:68, Luke 11:13). Therefore God created us, 
        designed us and formed us to be good all the time as well. We just need to put that in our mind and put that into practice. We cannot be perfect in an 
        instant but when we do that everyday, doing at least one good thing everyday, it will become a habbit and eventually it will become our behavior and our 
        character... and be like Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are God's creation and we possess His goodness. Thus, we should live and carry on in our life His goodness for his glory and that is our mission as 
        Christians - Matthew 5:16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is 
        in heaven.

        <h4>Proverbs 4:20-22 <br> 
        My son, pay attention to what I say; turn your ear to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to 
        those who find them and health to one’s whole body.

        James 3:13<br>
        Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.<br><br>
        Joshua 1:8<br>
        Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be 
        prosperous and successful.
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
        As Christians and believers of God, we should not forget or neglect to read and reflect on His word. Make it a habbit everyday to read even at least one 
        verse from the Bible so we may be guided by His words and we may apply it and guard our thoughts, our heart and intention, our words and actions. If we 
        want to live in peace, we should understand the word of God. Moreover, it will make us wise and more understanding; and we will be able to handle and deal 
        everything with love and humility and gentleness. As we read and practice the word of God everyday, the fruit of the Holy Spirit becomes evident in our 
        life and it brings healing to our soul,  our mind and our body as well because we can fully trust God and surrender everything to Him 
        </p>
        <p>
        We get to know more about God as we meditate on His word day and night, understand His purpose on our life and we'll have a deeper connection with Him. We 
        may sometimes find the word of God difficult to understand but we can pray and ask for the Holy Spirit to help us understand God's word. We may also look 
        for Bible studies, lessons and reflections so we may learn more about the Word of God and/or attend Bible talks and have some fellowship with the brothers 
        and sisters from the church and gain insights from them

        <h4>2 Corinthians 12:9-10<br> 
        But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my 
        weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, 
        in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

        With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. <br><br>
        1 Corinthians 10:13 <br>
        No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what 
        you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
        Who can be happy when problems and difficulties in life are encountered. How can someone be thankful on the occurence of different adversities in life. 
        That is so very natural for us human.. to feel down, sad, emotional, stressed and even depressed. But if we believe in God and we hold on to our faith and 
        to God's promises, we'll have hope. We need to keep on trusting God, that He is a faithful God and He will never leave nor forsake us - Deuteronomy 31:8
        </p>
        <p>
        Is there anything too hard for the Lord - Genesis 18:14 God created the universe and all the planets and creatures on it including us. Imagine the details 
        and all the parts of our body and their functionalities. God carefully planned and created all these things. So do you think God does not know all our 
        worries, problems and situations? Everything has its purpose, just try to reflect what God might be making us realize on every situation. God allows us to 
        experience these predicament so we may be able to realize that we need God, we are nothing without God and all that we have comes from God. And so when we 
        feel down, we can always run to our Father and we can experience His faithfulness, His goodness and love. And so we become strong through our faith in 
        God, because we know that we have a powerful God and as it is written in Matthew 19:26: “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are 
        possible.” 
        </p>
        <p>We can always run to God through prayers, tell God all the things that are happening in your life and read the word of God so you may be encouraged and 
        find peace and wisdom so you'll be guided by the Holy Spirit on what to do with your situations. God will not give you a situation that you cannot 
        surpass.. 1 Corinthians 10:13 No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what 
        you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.</p>

        Do you believe that everything that we have came from God? We owe everything to God, we don't possess anything in this world. God gave us all these things 
        so we may live and surpass everyday's challenges and situations. God blesses us these things so we may use it for His glory and for good works. And when 
        He blesses us more and abundantly and more than we have prayed for, it's because God saw our generous heart and He want to use us as His channel of 
        blessings to others. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Be thankful for all the blessings that we received from God may it be small or big for every good and perfect gift is from above (James 1:17). And let us 
        use these blessings for good works, for God's glory. God is giving us these abundant blessings for a reason.. to be generous, to help others, to share 
        your blessings to others so our Father may be lifted up and be glorified.. whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31)
