         <h4>John 5:24 <br> 
         I tell you the truth, those who listen to my message and believe in God who sent me have eternal life. They will never be condemned for their sins, but 
         they already have passed from death to life. 
         </h4></p>
         <p>
         <h4>Cross References:</h4>
         1 John 3:14<br>
         We know that we already have passed from death to life because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death.<br><br>
         Keypoints:<br>
         1. Listen to the message<br>
         2. Believe in God<br>
         3. Will never be condemned for their sins<br>
         4. Eternal life<br>
         5. Passed from death to life
         </p>
         
         <h4>Reflection</h4>
         <p>One of the indicators that a person has moved from the realm of evil to realm of God is LOVE. In order for us to pass from death to life is what is 
         being said in 1 John 3:14 "we should love each other" and 1 John 4:7-8 "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has 
         been born of God and knows God. Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love 
         </p>
         <p>So we may not be condemned from our sins and so we can have eternal life, we need to listen to God's message and believe in Him. And the very core of           God's message is His commandment to us that is to live like Christ, be like Christ - that is to love God and our neighbors as we love ourselves.
         </p>
         <p>God even command us to love our enemy - just like us when we were still sinners, we are considered His enemies. But God gave His Son to us so we may 
         be redeemed from darkness.
         </p>
         <p>And we can fully know and experience this kind of love that God has for us is when we read and listen to God's words and messages and believe to what 
         it says and believe God who is the major context of the Bible and Jesus as our Savior.
         </p>
         <p>Thus, what we feed our mind becomes our mindset and beliefs, so make it a habbit to read the Bible and apply it to your everyday life to have a 
         renewed and transformed life in Christ. Amen..

        <h4>2 Corinthians 5:18-19 <br> 
        All this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to 
        Himself in Christ, not counting people's sins against them. And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation

        3. Ministry of Reconciliation<br>
        4. Not Counting People's Sin<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>It is so evident how God loves us so much and would want us to be reconciled to Him. With His vast and unfathomable knowledge, wisdom and 
        understanding, He knew that the humankind would inherit the sins comitted by Adam and Eve and that everyone would fall short and will commit sin except 
        for One, the One He loves (Ephesians 1:6) and so He gave His Son to us as a ransom for our sins through the blood of Jesus, and we are now reconciled to 
        God and we can come freely to God without recalling and counting our sins
        </p>
        <p>The only thing that we should do is to be humble to accept our need to repent for our sins through Jesus, change our ways (Romans 12:2) and transform 
        our  mindset, trust and acknowledge God in all we do (Proverbs 3:5-6) and accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior - Romans 10:9-11 "That if you confess 
        with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord", and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you 
        believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved." As the scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in Him will never be put 
        to shame"

        1. Rely on the love of God <br>
        2. God is love <br>
        3. Who lives in love lives in God <br>
        4. God lives to those who lives in love <br>
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>The very nature of God is love. He loves us whatever situation and status we are in. But sometimes with our limited understanding and circumstances 
        we encounter, we question and doubted the love of God; we sometimes tend to focus on the trick of the devil, the confusion and conflict the devil is 
        inflicting to us; the lies, envy, jealousy that the devil is making us feel so we would think we are worthless and we don't deserve the love of God. 
        But take note that God has always a good plan out of our situation; there's always a purpose and let's trust God on that purpose is for His glory and 
        that we may feel His unconditional love. Trust that God is love and when we believe in Him, we have the privilege to experience His love
        </p>
        <p>And as believers of God and if we want to represent God in our life, we should apply 1 Corinthians 16:14 "Let all that you do be done in love" and 
        because God is love and so we must love one another

        No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours, through Christ who loves us 
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>God in His very nature, which is love can't bear or endure to see us got separated from Him because of our sins. With His great love for us, He gave 
        His only begotten Son to us to cleanse us from our sins and redeemed us through Christ's death on the cross. God sacrificed His own son for us so we may 
        be reconciled with God. What a great love God has for us...</p>
        <p>Romans 8:32 Since He did not spare even His own son but gave him up for us all, won't he also give us everything else? God want us to be with Him in 
        His Kingdom; to get us back and be with Him forever and the reason why Jesus became flesh and acted as ransom for our sins... Romans 8:39 nothing in all 
        creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord. Isn't that a great love from God?

        <h4>1 Corinthians 16:14 <br> 
        Let everything you do be done in love
        </h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>It is difficult to do everything in love especially when you are not feeling ok, if you're feeling down, if you're struggling, if you're facing 
        problems, challenges, conflict and different adversities in life. But if we are going to look at the life of Jesus in the Bible, he too wasn't spared 
        from these kind of situations, He was persecuted, tempted, accused and betrayed. However, he overcame the different temptations and difficulties and 
        continued on his journey and did his role and God's purpose of His life.. that even the sinners whom considered to be God's enemies were saved because 
        that's what Jesus came for, to save the sinners and that's the great love of God and Jesus by giving up His own life, endured the pain and suffering on 
        the cross for us 
        </p>
        <p>
        In our present time, how can we do that? If we focus ourselves on the goal of being with God in his kingdom someday, we need to follow Jesus and deny 
        ourselves.. that is whatever situation we are in, we should always represent Jesus in our life, we don't lift ourselves up but people should be able to 
        praise and thank God for the experience they encounter through us. Since God is love and as Christians, we should represent God and thus we should love 
        our neighbors as we love ourselves. An example of this is empathy, compassion, grace, forgiveness, and the manifestation of the fruit of the Spirit and 
        its application in our life towards how we deal with other people

        <h4>2 Corinthians 5:17 <br> 
        Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new

        <h4>Cross References:</h4>
        Luke 19:10<br>
        For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.<br><br>
        Romans 12:2<br>
        Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will 
        is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.<br><br>
        John 3:3<br>
        Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, unless you are born again, you cannot see the Kingdom of God.”
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
        It is easier said than done - ..to be a new creation, ..to be born again, ..be transformed. But what is it for us when we do these things? If we believe 
        that there is life after death, then where do you want to spend it? Our life here on earth is just temporary and our goal should be to prepare our soul 
        while we are still here, so when the time comes and God took our life, we will have our eternal life with God
        </p>
        <p>
        How can we be a new creation, be born again and be transformed? The Bible tells us to believe in Christ and follow Him, His teachings and how He 
        lived His life. Jesus became human, He experienced life the same way we are experiencing it today, so what He taught in the Bible is applicable to us 
        too.. He came to save us and He did it because of love. When we truly understand the depth of God's love for us and when we truly desire and 
        intentionally apply God's word in our life, we will become a new creation  
        </p>
        <p>
        Everyday is a new beginning where we can start a new way of thinking, another chance to live a new life and become better for God everyday for His glory.
